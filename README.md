This macro for Bit Heroes aims to simplify gameplay. Currently, it uses image detection for afk farming, ideal for running while you sleep. So far, it supports missions only, but I'm working on a GUI with Pygame. Future features will include PvP, Boss, Raid, Expedition, Coliseum, and Fishing. Many updates are planned!
